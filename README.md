# FoxBox
(WIP) Program that I am working on that enables a user to open up several applications at once.
There are a couple errors, but this is the open source beta for FoxBox.

------------------------
-----SETUP GUIDE--------
------------------------
1) Download FoxBox.zip and extract FoxBox into myDocuments folder
2) Run FoxBox.exe
3) Supports a maximum of 10 files at the moment. More to come in the future.

------------------------
---------TO DO----------
------------------------
1) Fix bugs that are causing the crash
2) Possibly turn the project into an installer for easier use.
3) Add a execute on startup option
